<h1>🎮 SpeedDoodle — A Vertical Platformer Built with Godot</h1>

SpeedDoodle is a fast-paced platform jumping game crafted in Godot, where every leap tests your reflexes and strategy. Ascend through endless platforms, dodge hazards, and collect quirky items to enhance your run!

🧑‍🎨 Custom Skins
Start your journey in style—players can personalize their character with different skins before diving into the action.

🎁 Power-Up Items
Throughout the game, two special items randomly spawn to give you an edge:

Spring: Instantly boosts your jump to help you cover more distance.

Bubble: Temporarily slows your descent, offering more control during tricky climbs.

⚠️ Dynamic Difficulty System
The higher you climb, the harder it gets! Be prepared for:

Moving Platforms: They keep you on your toes.

Trap Platforms: Not everything solid is safe.

Strategize each jump, because one wrong move might send you tumbling back down!
